# ROT13 Program Readme

### Introduction


This is a simple ROT13 (Rotate by 13 places) program. ROT13 is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it in the alphabet. ROT13 is a special case of the Caesar cipher developed in ancient Rome.

### Features

+ Text Encryption: Encrypt any text using the ROT13 cipher.
+ Text Decryption: Decrypt any text encrypted using the ROT13 cipher.
+ Case Preservation: The program preserves the case of the letters, meaning uppercase letters will remain uppercase, and lowercase letters will remain lowercase after encryption or decryption.
+ Support for Alphabetic Characters Only: Non-alphabetic characters (such as numbers, punctuation, etc.) remain unchanged during encryption or decryption.

Would you like to encrypt or decrypt a message?
Enter 'e' for encryption or 'd' for decryption: e
